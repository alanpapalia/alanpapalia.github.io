      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the final project in a mechanical design course at the University of
Illinois I worked on a team to design a 3-speed transmission, complete with idle
and reverse gears. In the design of this transmission I used fundamental machine
design calculations to determine the proper gear ratios and gear tooth sizing.
This included hand-calculations and finite element simulations to predict the
gear tooth root stress for every gear pairing. In addition to this I predicted
the bearing load for each bearing supporting each shaft to verify that we were
within the bearing specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fabricated the transmission with a waterjet and performed testing on a rig which was provided to us. Using this we were able to estimate the mechanical efficiencies of each gear pairing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aluminum Fuel Tank</title>
      <link>https://alanpapalia.github.io/project/fsae-fuel-tank/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alanpapalia.github.io/project/fsae-fuel-tank/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the Illini Motorsports Formula SAE team I designed and fabricated our aluminum fuel tank. There were several constraints and considerations which guided the design. First and foremost, was driver safety. The fuel tank had to be packaged in such a way that any malfunction could not put the driver at risk. Additional packaging constraints required that the fuel tank had to compactly fit in it&amp;rsquo;s assigned area. In addition, serviceability was a key consideration in that the fuel tank needed to be easily accessed in the event of failures such as fuel pressure drops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond high-level qualitative measurements, fuel tank design also required consideration of the effects of fuel slosh and the weight of the tank. A thin aluminum sheet was selected to reduce weight while still ensuring the tank could be made without leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuel slosh has the potential to cause dynamic fuel starvation issues and impact vehicle dynamics. To reduce fuel slosh internal baffling was used. To determine an effective baffling design I set up computational fluid dynamics situations which used inertial loads recorded during real racing events and observed the fuel slosh caused during different baffle designs. The effects of baffling could be measured by the amount of time that fuel was present at the designed outlet and the net kinetic energy of the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With both the internal and external geometries designed, I made the fabrication drawings, waterjet all of the sheet parts, hand-bent all sheet metal into it&amp;rsquo;s final shape, profiled the tubes for the filler neck of the tank, and welded the entire assembly. The fuel tank was then leak-tested under pressure to ensure that it would be safe under operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Carbon Fiber Hybrid-Monocoque Chassis</title>
      <link>https://alanpapalia.github.io/project/fsae-monocoque/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alanpapalia.github.io/project/fsae-monocoque/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My senior year I led the complete redesign of our team&amp;rsquo;s hybrid monocoque chassis (part spaceframe and part monocoque). The redesign centered around the monocoque section, with substantial changes from the previous year&amp;rsquo;s design required for reasons of structural safety. The redesigned chassis needed to meet several structural baselines as predetermined by the Formula SAE committee. In addition, the previous year had received feedback on poor driver visibility and had several sections which disrupted smooth aerodynamics, limiting downstream aerodynamic performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of our monocoque design space was limited by several hard constraints.
As is key with any composite structure, our design had to be a shape which could
be produced on a mold. In addition, the design was limited to composite
materials which were readily available to us. Each section of the
monocoque had to meet all criteria established by the Formula SAE rules
committee. Finally, the monocoque had to be able to withstand the full range of suspension loads it would see during driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond these hard constraints, I set design constraints on driver visibility,
requiring that our shortest driver would be able to see at least 7 feet in front
of the car. With all of these constraints in place, I set about finding a design
which looked to minimize the weight of the monocoque while maintaining smooth
airflow. To maintain smooth airflow I coordinated with our aerodynamics
subsystem to model the airflow off the monocoque under a range of driving
conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;chassis_cad.png&#34; alt=&#34;CAD&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34; style=&#34;padding-bottom:80px&#34;&gt;CAD of the final chassis design&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To minimize the weight I coordinated several rounds of mechanical testing of
sandwich panels. These tests were driven by a mechanical properties tool which
used classical laminate theory to predict the properties of a sandwich panel
composite. This tool allowed us to find ideal starting points for the design of
each section of the car and then refine the design through mechanical testing to
derive the true properties of each sandwich panel. As such, we were able to
determine panel designs which met the structural requirements provided while
still finding a minimal areal density of each panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;panel_testing.png&#34; alt=&#34;Panel Testing&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34; style=&#34;padding-bottom:80px&#34;&gt;Sandwich panel testing to derive material properties&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, design work did not stop here. As previously mentioned, to manufacture
a composite structure we needed some form of mold, but our equipment was not
able to machine a mold of suitable size in-house. This left us the options of
either manufacturing the mold in parts and attempting to align the sections or
outsourcing the machining. Thanks to our wonderful sponsors at &lt;a href =
&#34;https://en.machinetools.camozzi.com/who/ingersoll-machine-tools.kl&#34;&gt; Ingersoll
Machine Tools &lt;/a&gt; we were able to work alongside them to design molds which
could be machined on their large-scale CNC mills while meeting our critical
dimension requirements. This allowed for improved tolerance on the molds,
resulting in a higher quality finished monocoque. To make use of their machines
I had to collaborate with engineers working with our sponsor to ensure that our
molds were machineable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mold_1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Molds&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34; style=&#34;padding-bottom:80px&#34;&gt;Molds after sponsored machining&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After receiving the molds from our sponsor I worked with members of our
composite subsystem to make carbon-fiber tooling, which would be the final molds
for our monocoque. This was done so that the tools would match the coefficient
of thermal expansion between the tooling and the monocoque. With the carbon
tooling manufactured, our team handled five successive composite layups and cure
cycles in an on-campus autoclave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;tooling_cure.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tooling&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34; style=&#34;padding-bottom:80px&#34;&gt;Loading the CFRP tooling for the upper half of the monocoque into an autoclave&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lower_layup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Layup&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34; style=&#34;padding-bottom:80px&#34;&gt;Layup of the lower half of the monocoque inside CFRP tooling&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Formula Racecar System Design</title>
      <link>https://alanpapalia.github.io/project/fsae-system-architecture/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alanpapalia.github.io/project/fsae-system-architecture/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the 2018-2019 academic year I was team captain for the University of Illinois &lt;a href=&#34;https://motorsports.illinois.edu/&#34;&gt; Illini Motorsports Formula SAE &lt;/a&gt; team. As team captain, I oversaw over 40 mechanical, electrical, and software engineers in the entire design and manufacturing process of our formula-style racecar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This top down design process meant lengthy discussions among team leadership to
establish overarching team goals. This process involved the use of competition point simulators to estimate the perceived competition advantages given by each target, with qualitative arguments given when there were factors which could not be easily simulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these goals I ensured that each subsystem on our team would target projects and design criteria that focused on our team-wide objectives and that our individual design goals represented the team&amp;rsquo;s goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond high-level planning I also focused on the interface between subsystems and ensured that subsystems were taking a holistic view on their project such that design compromises were made between subsystems for the benefit of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my Mechanical Design I class a group of us designed a ballerina-themed
walker. This included all forms of linkage analysis to determine the appropriate
walker mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

      <title>Steel Spaceframe Jigging</title>
      <link>https://alanpapalia.github.io/project/fsae-chassis-jig/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://alanpapalia.github.io/project/fsae-chassis-jig/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To accurately manufacture the steel-tube spaceframe component of our Formula SAE
car I designed and manufactured a jigging system out of steel sheets. The
jigging was designed such that the frame could be assembled inside the jigging,
welded, and then normalized with an oxy-acetylene torch to reduce thermal
stresses and warpage of the final weldment.&lt;/p&gt;
