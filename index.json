This could be due to the environment being highly repetitive or there being a general sparsity of features. In these situations the performance of traditional localization techniques tends to degrade and can give highly incorrect errors.\nA key direction in my research is leveraging the use of inter-agent ranging, a measurement which does not depend on environmental observation, to aid the multi-robot localization task. However, there is a caveat, the quality of range-based localization varies based on the connectivity and spatial arrangement of the network of agents.\nIn this work I developed a planner which allowed for networks of agents to efficiently plan trajectories that allowed them to stay in configurations which were favorable for range-based localization.

My part of the project would allow for quantitative statistics on the grasping experiments.\nTo approach the problem I developed a Python library that was capable of interfacing with Intel RGB-D cameras and recording several image streams in parallel. To then perform object tracking several state-of-the-art pose estimation techniques were implemented and compared.

There were several constraints and considerations which guided the design. First and foremost, was driver safety. The fuel tank had to be packaged in such a way that any malfunction could not put the driver at risk. Additional packaging constraints required that the fuel tank had to compactly fit in it\u0026rsquo;s assigned area. In addition, serviceability was a key consideration in that the fuel tank needed to be easily accessed in the event of failures such as fuel pressure drops.\nBeyond high-level qualitative measurements, fuel tank design also required consideration of the effects of fuel slosh and the weight of the tank. A thin aluminum sheet was selected to reduce weight while still ensuring the tank could be made without leaks.\nFuel slosh has the potential to cause dynamic fuel starvation issues and impact vehicle dynamics. To reduce fuel slosh internal baffling was used. To determine an effective baffling design I set up computational fluid dynamics situations which used inertial loads recorded during real racing events and observed the fuel slosh caused during different baffle designs. The effects of baffling could be measured by the amount of time that fuel was present at the designed outlet and the net kinetic energy of the fuel.\nWith both the internal and external geometries designed, I made the fabrication drawings, waterjet all of the sheet parts, hand-bent all sheet metal into it\u0026rsquo;s final shape, profiled the tubes for the filler neck of the tank, and welded the entire assembly. The fuel tank was then leak-tested under pressure to ensure that it would be safe under operating conditions.\n","date":1601424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601424000,"objectID":"b2eeb7a5d11c1b6bdfc9ca59b90686ef","permalink":"https://alanpapalia.github.io/project/fsae-fuel-tank/","publishdate":"2020-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fsae-fuel-tank/","section":"project","summary":"Numerical simulations, design, and full fabrication of the fuel tank","tags":["Design"],"title":"Aluminum Fuel Tank","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My senior year I led the complete redesign of our team\u0026rsquo;s hybrid monocoque chassis (part spaceframe and part monocoque). The redesign centered around the monocoque section, with substantial changes from the previous year\u0026rsquo;s design required for reasons of structural safety. The redesigned chassis needed to meet several structural baselines as predetermined by the Formula SAE committee. In addition, the previous year had received feedback on poor driver visibility and had several sections which disrupted smooth aerodynamics, limiting downstream aerodynamic performance.\nThe scope of our monocoque design space was limited by several hard constraints. As is key with any composite structure, our design had to be a shape which could be produced on a mold. In addition, the design was limited to composite materials which were readily available to us. Each section of the monocoque had to meet all criteria established by the Formula SAE rules committee. Finally, the monocoque had to be able to withstand the full range of suspension loads it would see during driving.\nBeyond these hard constraints, I set design constraints on driver visibility, requiring that our shortest driver would be able to see at least 7 feet in front of the car. With all of these constraints in place, I set about finding a design which looked to minimize the weight of the monocoque while maintaining smooth airflow. To maintain smooth airflow I coordinated with our aerodynamics subsystem to model the airflow off the monocoque under a range of driving conditions.\nCAD of the final chassis design To minimize the weight I coordinated several rounds of mechanical testing of sandwich panels. These tests were driven by a mechanical properties tool which used classical laminate theory to predict the properties of a sandwich panel composite. This tool allowed us to find ideal starting points for the design of each section of the car and then refine the design through mechanical testing to derive the true properties of each sandwich panel. As such, we were able to determine panel designs which met the structural requirements provided while still finding a minimal areal density of each panel.\nSandwich panel testing to derive material properties However, design work did not stop here. As previously mentioned, to manufacture a composite structure we needed some form of mold, but our equipment was not able to machine a mold of suitable size in-house. This left us the options of either manufacturing the mold in parts and attempting to align the sections or outsourcing the machining. Thanks to our wonderful sponsors at Ingersoll Machine Tools  we were able to work alongside them to design molds which could be machined on their large-scale CNC mills while meeting our critical dimension requirements. This allowed for improved tolerance on the molds, resulting in a higher quality finished monocoque. To make use of their machines I had to collaborate with engineers working with our sponsor to ensure that our molds were machineable.\nMolds after sponsored machining After receiving the molds from our sponsor I worked with members of our composite subsystem to make carbon-fiber tooling, which would be the final molds for our monocoque. This was done so that the tools would match the coefficient of thermal expansion between the tooling and the monocoque. With the carbon tooling manufactured, our team handled five successive composite layups and cure cycles in an on-campus autoclave.\nLoading the CFRP tooling for the upper half of the monocoque into an autoclave Layup of the lower half of the monocoque inside CFRP tooling","date":1601424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601424000,"objectID":"89ba27e35edc5ef7bed38fa08525d301","permalink":"https://alanpapalia.github.io/project/fsae-monocoque/","publishdate":"2020-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fsae-monocoque/","section":"project","summary":"Design, simulation, validation, and fabrication of hybrid-monocoque chassis","tags":["Design"],"title":"Carbon Fiber Hybrid-Monocoque Chassis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"For the 2018-2019 academic year I was team captain for the University of Illinois Illini Motorsports Formula SAE  team.

This can also be used to get a rough distance between two phones, something which many teams have tried to use to get contact tracing information. However, this approach has proven challenging, with the measurements being highly noisy and there being a good chance of two phones not having a measurement despite being within sensing range of each other.\nTo try to combat these challenges, the contact tracing problem can be considered a sensor network localization problem. This is a long-studied class of algorithms which attempt to localize members of a network using only pairwise distance measurements between network members. Modeling contact tracing as a network localization problem serves two distinct benefits. First, this allows for multiple measurements to be used to try to estimate the distance between phones, combatting the effects of noisy data. Secondly, this allows for the distance between two phones to be estimated even if there is no corresponding distance measurement between these two devices.\nIn this collaboration I worked with Lilly Clark  to test out a number of sensor network localization approaches for contact tracing.
