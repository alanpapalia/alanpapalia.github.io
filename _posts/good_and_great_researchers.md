**Disclaimer**: this is a person opinion as of today. I still have a lot to see and
my views are more than likely to evolve over time. If anyone has different opinions or
any thoughts on this, I would love to hear them!


Most people in academia are sharp. They can grasp technical concepts and are
generally good at applying them to new problems. My opinion is that most notions
of "intelligence" are not what distinguish good and great researchers from the rest
of the pack. In my experience, I've seen that some of the brightest people do not
necessarily separate themselves from the pack.

I want to start by talking about what I think makes a *good* researcher and then
extend that a little further by what I think makes a *great* researcher.

# What makes a good researcher?

- focus on their problems
- intellectual curiousity and a general drive to learn
- they enjoy what they do
- self-motivated and can work independently
- good at identifying and acknowledging the gaps in their knowledge and their limitations

Note that none of these traits are about being the smartest person in the room. Furthermore,
all of these traits can be cultivated and developed over time. The only one that is not
necessarily developed is actually enjoying the work (and that's okay! sometimes you just
don't like a given topic or area -- for example, I learned as an undergrad
that I would be a very unmotivated cleanroom engineer).)

I think this is
important to recognize because it means that anyone (working in an area they like)
can become a good researcher.


# What separates great researchers from good ones?

The difference between good and great comes entirely down to the problems they choose to
work on. Many major academics have said this in different ways.

- Einstein: work in physics as opposed to math because I can tell what problems matter
- someone in CS: important and unimportant problems take about the same time to solve
