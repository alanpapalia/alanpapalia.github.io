**Disclaimer**: this is a personal opinion as of today.
My views are more than likely to evolve over time and there may be nuance on
this that I unintentionally fail to capture here.  If anyone has different
opinions (or any thoughts on this) I would love to hear them!

Most people in academia are sharp. They can grasp technical concepts and are
generally good at applying them to new problems. My opinion is that the standard
notions of "intelligence" are not what distinguish good and great researchers
from the rest of the pack. In my experience, I've seen that some of the
brightest people do not necessarily separate themselves from the pack.

I want to start by talking about what I think makes a *good* researcher and then
extend that a little further by what I think makes a *great* researcher.

# What makes a good researcher?

- focus on their problems
- intellectual curiosity and a general drive to learn
- they enjoy what they do
- self-motivated and can work independently
- good at identifying and acknowledging the gaps in their knowledge and their limitations

Note that none of these traits are about being the smartest person in the room. Furthermore,
all of these traits can be cultivated and developed over time. The only one that is not
necessarily developed is actually enjoying the work (and that's okay! sometimes you just
don't like a given topic or area -- for example, I learned as an undergrad
that I would be a very unmotivated cleanroom engineer).)

I think this is important to recognize because it means that anyone (working in
an area they like) can become a good researcher.


# What separates great researchers from good ones?

- they work on the right problems
- Think about how they can do things better: with each experience, what information is gained and how does this change future approaches.

The difference between good and great comes entirely down to the problems they choose to
work on. Many major academics have said this in different ways.

- Einstein: work in physics as opposed to math because I can tell what problems matter
- someone in CS: important and unimportant problems take about the same time to solve
