**What's your advising philosophy?**

I’ve gotten this question (and variants thereof) a lot since accepting my
faculty position, so I wanted to write down some initial thoughts.  I've been
fortunate to have a number of great mentors with very different styles (and the
lucky opportunity to work with and observe many more). My beliefs are largely
taken from what I learned from them, both in terms of what I want to take from
their styles and what I want to do differently.  I also want to emphasize that
this is a living document. I expect my views to evolve as I gain more experience
and learn from my students.

Much of this may not be surprising or controversial - but writing it down helps me
communicate my expectations clearly and consistently.

**Last updated:** July 8, 2025 - right before starting my faculty position.

# My Advising Philosophy

## What is the point of a PhD?

A PhD is a program to train independent researchers. I hope that every student
that comes through our lab will leave with the ability to perform world-class
research.  I think the best way to become a world-class researcher is to try to
perform world-class research.

Of course, becoming an independent, world-class researcher doesn’t happen
overnight, but this is the goal to strive for.

**Disclaimer**: I don't have strong feelings that PhD students should
commit to an academic career or even a research career. The independent
skills developed during a PhD are valuable in many different careers, and I
want to support students in whatever path they choose. I myself very seriously
debated leaving academia during my PhD, and I think that consideration and
reflection was incredibly valuable.

## On world-class research

I do want to be careful about what I mean by "world-class research." This
does not mean cranking out *n* publications at the top conferences every year.
Rather, the point is to:
- identify meaningful problems worth solving (either practically or theoretically),
- develop deep understanding of both the problem and the state of the art,
- contextualize the work in the broader field,
- advance knowledge meaningfully (through new theory, methods, or empirical results), and
- communicate those results clearly to the broader community.

Of course, this is a very high-level overview of what I think world-class
research is and may verge on being so vague that it means nothing. That's a bit
inevitable, as projects can differ sufficiently that what makes good research in
an area can differ substantially.

The point, is that the goal is to do good, thoughtful work and then clearly
communicate it to the broader community.

### The magnitude of world-class research problems and breakthroughs

I also want to take a little more time to talk about what progress looks like
for major problems. Here I consider a "major problem" to be a general question
or challenge that is both important to society (impactful if solved) and
technically interesting (i.e., progress will inform our understanding of
robotics, AI, etc. and not just be a one-off solution to a problem).

Most "breakthroughs" are less about single discoveries and more about the
accumulation of incremental results. Often, what gets labeled a “breakthrough”
is a paper that brings coherence to prior work, introduces a new framing, or
synthesizes methods across fields.

This is great research, but it's important to remember that real progress often
looks like slow, thoughtful work chipping away at problems.


**Why am I saying this?** It's to emphasize that while we work (at the high level) on
large, important problems, the actual contributions we make to those problems
are often more gradual and chipping away at pieces of the problem. This is what
good work often looks like! It can be easy to get caught up in the romanticized
notion of breakthroughs and have that become a mental block to working on a
problem.  Romanticizing breakthroughs can be a mental block; persistent effort
matters more.

## Student background

I don't expect a super-specific technical background from students.  There are a
lot of different flavors of research that I'm interested in, ranging from
theoretical and algorithmic (i.e., you can do all of your work with a laptop and
Python/MATLAB/Julia/etc.) to more experimental and deploying real robots in the
real world (what is typically called field robotics).

Students should generally have a solid background in programming, be comfortable
with math, and — more than anything — have a strong willingness to learn.

You should be prepared to spend substantial time independently developing your
technical skills, especially in more advanced areas like mathematics and
probability.

## Independence and choosing research topics

At the end of the day, I think students should be determining their own research
topics. My role is largely to assist in identifying interesting problems,
helping students develop their ideas, and providing guidance on how to approach
solving them.

Now this differs from student to student, but it's reasonable for first-year
students to start by being given a few ideas that I think are interesting, worth
pursuing, and adequately scoped as "first problems" to make traction on. As
students progress, I expect them to take more and more ownership of their
research and start to identify their own problems and ideas.

Of course, even the most senior of researchers still collaborate with others and
seek out advice and feedback. Senior students should be able to work fully
independently in the day-to-day—defining research questions, scoping tractable
problems, designing experiments or theory, and driving progress without needing
constant feedback. At this stage, my role will likely shift more toward a
sounding board and strategic advisor to refine the finished product: someone to
help connect the dots across ideas, flag potential pitfalls, and push students
to think deeper or more broadly when needed.

**Disclaimer**: Funding opportunities may influence the direction of research
in the lab. I hope that students feel like research topics are still entirely
of their choosing, and my aim is to generally find highly flexible funding
opportunities that align with general lab interests. However, like all labs,
funding may have some affect on research.

## Proposing ideas

From the first day, I expect students to be proposing their own ideas and
solutions to problems. The main reason is that identifying research problems is
a skill that requires constant practice and refinement.  One of the best aspects
of the lab I was in as a PhD student was that students were fully expected to
propose and support their own research agendas.  This was really hard,
especially at first, but I think it led to a level of individual growth as a
researcher and independent thinker that would have been hard to achieve
otherwise.

## What is a good problem?

There's a lot of writing on this that I think is largely in agreement, so I won't
repeat it all here (but see my [collection of PhD advice]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2025/phd-advice/))
for more in depth discussions.

One useful framework (credit to Robert Mahony for sharing this) is that a good
problem is evaluated in the following context:

- **Impact**: Is this problem important? Will solving it have a meaningful impact on the
  world? Is it a problem that people care about?
- **Novelty**: Is this problem new? Does it advance the state of the art and how we think about the problem?
- **Feasibility**: Is this problem tractable? Can we make meaningful progress on
  it in a reasonable time frame? Is it too big or too small?
- **Interest**: Do you care about this problem? Are you excited to work on it?
  Will you be able to sustain interest in it over the long term?
- **Resources**: Do you have the resources (time, funding, expertise) to tackle this problem?
  Are there collaborators or mentors who can help?

The right weighting of these factors depends on the student and circumstances.

E.g., for a first-year student, feasibility and interest may be more important
than novelty or impact. It can be useful to start with a problem that is good to
get traction on, even if it is not the most impactful or novel problem (though
we should be considering these factors as well). The first problem I worked on
as a PhD student was not particularly impactful, but it gave me a good launching
point and allowed me to develop my skills and understanding of the field.

## Mentorship style

On this, I'll speak at a high level. I think there's no one-size-fits-all style
and what works best is completely dependent on the people. There are a few
common things that should generalize across all students:

**Student development**: as students progress, they should take more and more ownership of their research (choosing problems, developing ideas, etc.)

**Independence**: I will provide guidance and mentorship, but I expect students to be self-motivated and take the initiative to learn and develop their ideas

**Priorities**: who we are as people is more important than who we are as researchers (though research is an important and valuable part of society). Similarly, the order of priorities is: family (however you define that), health, and then research.

**Level of involvement**: I want to be an involved mentor who is there to help
students grow, but I also want to give students the space to develop their own
ideas and approaches. There's a line to walk here, and I expect to communicate
openly with students about how much guidance they want and need at any given
time. I do expect to discuss research ideas and approaches at a fairly detailed
level and be more engaged in the day-to-day of research than more senior
faculty. Of course, this is all highly dependent on the student and their
preferences/needs.

**Things I will work on with students**: I will work with students on
developing their ideas, scoping problems, designing experiments, and writing
papers. I value communication, and would argue the ability to clearly
communicate ideas is the most important skill for anyone to develop. I
plan to work with students on their writing, presentations, and other
communication skills.

**Expectations for students**: In general, I'll try to set clear
expectations for students. If expectations are unclear, I want
students to be comfortable asking for clarification. I will also
encourage students to set their own expectations for themselves and
communicate those to me.

**Career development**: I want to help students develop their careers, whether
that is in academia, industry, or elsewhere. I will support students in
finding internships, jobs, and other opportunities that align with their
interests and goals. I will also help students prepare for the job market,
including reviewing application materials, conducting mock interviews, and
providing advice on how to navigate the job market. I'm lucky to have
a number of colleagues who are in academia, industry, startups, and
a range of other careers. If students are interested in exploring
different career paths, I will help connect them.

## Communication

I aim to meet with each student regularly—usually once per week or every other
week, depending on the stage of the project and the student's needs. Between
meetings, I encourage students to reach out via email or Slack with updates or
thoughts. You don’t need to have a polished result to reach out; it's often
more useful (and interesting) to discuss the challenges that arise during
research.

## Authorship and collaboration

I believe in giving credit where credit is due. Students who contribute
meaningfully to a project—whether through ideas, implementation, writing, or
experiments—should be included as co-authors. I follow common authorship
conventions in robotics, but I’m always happy to discuss expectations openly.

Collaborations across labs and disciplines are strongly encouraged. Many great
ideas come from interactions outside our immediate circle, and I’ll support
students in building those bridges.

## Time management and work-life balance

A PhD is a marathon, not a sprint. I expect students to work hard—but also to
rest, take care of themselves, and have lives outside the lab. Sustainable
progress requires balance. There may be intense stretches before deadlines, but
those should be the exception, not the rule.

If you're feeling burnt out or overwhelmed, please let me know. Timelines and
priorities can be shifted. Long-term health, both mental and physical, is
important for great work.

## Feedback and iteration

I give direct and detailed feedback, especially on writing, presentations, and
project direction. This is always aimed at helping you grow. You’re not expected
to “get it right” the first time. Iteration is part of research.

One thing that helps this process is being able to state what type of feedback
is desired.  E.g., if you're giving a talk for a lab meeting, you may want
feedback on the technical content or ideas. If you're preparing for a
presentation, the polish of the slides and the clarity of the message may be
more important.

Similarly, if it's worth remembering that what you present affects what feedback
you get.  A more polished presentation can lend to more focused feedback on the
presentation structure itself and the ideas (as opposed to notes of what was
unclear). It can be good to consider the state of a talk/presentation/paper
when asking for feedback to make sure that the desired type of feedback is
matched to the state of the work.

I appreciate students who engage with feedback thoughtfully, push back when they
disagree, and take ownership of revising their work.

## Graduation and career goals

A strong dissertation demonstrates your ability to do independent research and
make a meaningful contribution to your field. There’s no fixed number of papers
or years, but I expect students to graduate with at least a few substantial
pieces of work that form a coherent narrative.

I see part of my job as helping students prepare for their next step. A PhD develops
deep thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills that are valuable in
nearly any career path—whether that's academia, industry, startups, or something
else. I’m here to support you with advice, letters, connections, and guidance as
you navigate the job market.

## Reproducibility and research artifacts

We aim to produce work that others can build on. That means writing clean code,
documenting experiments, and making reproducible results whenever possible.

I don’t expect perfection, but I do expect students to aim for clarity and
reusability in their code and data handling, especially as projects mature.

## Final thoughts

Graduate school is an incredible opportunity for growth - as a thinker, a
doer, and a human being. My goal is to support each student in becoming an
independent, critical-thinker who is prepared for the next chapter,
whatever that may be. I care deeply about your success, and I’ll work hard to
support you. I ask that you do the same—for yourself, and for the lab community.
