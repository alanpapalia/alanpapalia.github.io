There are two different scenarios for understanding a field of research:
1) you likely just started in a new field and are trying to understand what
interesting research questions may be.
2) you have some familiarity with your field, and have a question you want to
start answering, but you don't know all of the specific literature that has
been published on it.

# I don't know what questions I want to ask.


# I know what questions I want to ask, but I don't know what the relevant literature is.

This is the time to go deep into an area and do what we call a "literature review".
This is a systematic way to find relevant literature on a specific topic.  The goal
is to find all of the relevant literature on a topic so that you can understand
the current state of the field and identify *precise* gaps in the literature that you can
address with your own research.

##  Bi-directional searching (via Google Scholar):

This is a straightforward way to find relevant literature. This is a 3-step process that should
be repeated until the set of relevant papers is stable (i.e., you are no longer
finding new papers).

  1) find a relevant paper
  2) look at which papers it cites to find more relevant papers (this should find papers that were published before it)
  3) look at which papers cite it to find more relevant papers (this should find papers that were published after it)

## PhD theses and dissertations (often have extensive literature reviews)

PhD theses and dissertations often have extensive literature reviews that can be a great


## Peer-based Discussion
