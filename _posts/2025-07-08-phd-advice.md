There's a lot of great advice out there for PhD students. Here I try to compile
some of the best advice I've come across, along with my own thoughts on the
matter. This is a living document, and I will update it as I find more advice or
as my own views evolve.

Of course, I don't fully agree with all of this (and I couldn't if I wanted to
-- some of the points in these resources are slightly contradictory). However, I
mostly agree with the spirit of these points, and I think that it is worth
understanding the perspective they come from.

Take things with grains of salt, and think critically about what matches your
system. Most of all, remember that a PhD is supposed to be fun (albeit often
type two fun -- not always "fun" in the moment, but deeply rewarding in
hindsight). If you find yourself not enjoying it, take a step back and think
about why that is.
