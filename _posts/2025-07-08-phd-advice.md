There's a lot of great advice out there for PhD students. Here I try to compile
some of the best advice I've come across, along with my own thoughts on the
matter. This is a living document, and I will update it as I find more advice or
as my own views evolve.

Since this page is no longer maintained - I tried to copy what I could into this page
</summary>


## 1. Stop caring about classes

Just do what you need to pass.

> Only spend time on classes once you’ve made progress on your research.

---

## 2. Undergrad versus PhD research

Every student admitted into PhD programs has a lot of potential for creative research, but very few realize it—not because they’re not smart, but due to lacking resilience, perseverance, metacognition, or self-discipline.

> These traits can be fostered through self-reflection and mentorship.

---

## 3. Uncertainty, isolation, and project scoping

- **Uncertainty:** You don’t know if your hard work will pay off.
- **Isolation:** Few people care about what you're doing.
- **Project scoping:** You don’t know how big your paper should be.

**What you should do:**
- Make consistent progress every day.
- Get mentor feedback every 1–2 weeks.
- Submit papers and get external feedback a few times a year.

---

## 4. Develop research taste

How?

- Read good recent papers recommended by your advisor.
- Assist others with their projects.
- Accept that a lot of mediocre work is necessary before developing taste. Keep grinding.

---

## 5. Most of the daily work won’t feel like “research”

If this happens, stay mindful of the big picture. Don’t get trapped in trivialities.

---

## 6. Understand your advisor

If your advisor is pre-tenure, helping them earn tenure will likely depend on your research output.

---

## 7. There is no perfect advisor

People succeed *despite* their advisor’s imperfections. Don’t rely solely on your advisor for your success.

---

## 8. Be patient

- The first 3 years of your PhD may not count toward your dissertation.
- No publications after 3 years? Still okay.
- If your advisor is untenured, expect pressure to publish sooner.

---

## 9. Make professors want to help you

They want to help students who already know how to do research and need less guidance.

> Show your potential to be a good researcher.

---

## 10. Find peer support

PhD isolation is the default. Seek out peers proactively.

---

## 11. Avoid infectious negativity

Even if you’re struggling, try not to spread negativity to others.

---

## 12. Be careful about advice from senior students outside your area

- They may not understand your specific challenges.
- But they *can* offer great advice about navigating your advisor.

---

## 13. Understand your job

Your job in a PhD is to **publish high-quality research papers that contribute valuable new knowledge**.

---

## 14. Make yourself accountable

Be accountable to:
- Other people (e.g., postdocs or collaborators),
- Deadlines (e.g., conference submissions, talks),
- Structures (e.g., lab meetings).

---

## 15. Develop a fixed work schedule

- Always do the most important thing first.
- Research is your #1 priority—not classes, TA work, or admin.

> Suggested: Work on research from 8–11am every day, uninterrupted.

---

## 16. Do everything you can to protect your mornings

Self-explanatory.

---

## 17. Politely turn down volunteer service work requests

Self-explanatory.

---

## 18. Push back against professors who overwork you as a TA

Self-explanatory.

---

## 19. Keep moving

If you’re stuck, **tell your advisor or mentors immediately**.

> Many PhDs fail not from lack of talent, but from getting stuck and demoralized.

---

## 20. Avoid the dreaded loop of despair

Getting stuck → no help → procrastination → worse outcomes.

---

## 21. Everyone is busy—ask for help anyway

If you’ve done your homework, it’s fine to ask busy people for help.

> You are not wasting anyone’s time by being prepared and showing desire to grow.

---

## 22. Managing your advisor

Advisors are good at **making decisions**.

> Don’t ask: *“What do you think of this draft?”*
> Ask: *“Given A and B, should I use model X, Y, or Z?”*

Make it easy for them to help you.

---

## 23. Contact hours

Don’t rely only on metrics like papers or awards.

> Instead, track your **daily contact hours** with core research.

Good target:
- 3–4 hours/day of focused work
- 1–2 hours/week of meetings with advisor

> “Focus on the action, not the result. The result will come.”

---

## 24. My project stinks… should I quit?

- If it’s **your own** project: try sticking with it for 3+ months.
- If it’s **someone else’s**: switch if you’ve earned authorship.
- Always aim to gain transferable skills—even if you leave a project.

> It’s easier to switch projects early in your PhD.

---

## 25. Writing papers

- Takes **much longer** than expected.
- Don’t worry about quality initially—get content down first.

> Even 12 pages of junk is better than a blank page.

---

## 26. Don’t worry about big-talkers

95% of research is done in silence. Don’t feel self-conscious about others who are louder.

> Silent excellence is still recognized.

---

## 27. Don’t compare yourself to other students

Self-explanatory.

---

## 28. Social media and online presence

- You **need** a personal website. It doesn’t need to be fancy.
- Use social media carefully.

> “It may seem like everyone is winning awards or publishing nonstop. Don’t let that derail you.”

> “It’s easier to post online than to grind on research. Focus on your real work.”

> **What matters most for your career is publishing well-regarded papers. Everything else is secondary.**

---

## 29. Commonly observed struggles

- If no faculty can summarize what you’re doing, your work may not be clear or scoped well.
- It’s helpful to be on your advisor’s **critical path**—it keeps you motivated and aligned.
