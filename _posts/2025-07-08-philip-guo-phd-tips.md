# Philip Guo's Tips for PhD Students

Since this page is no longer maintained - I tried to copy what I could into this
page. To be honest, I'm not sure if this is exactly what was on the original
page, but these are all points that are worth considering and it is useful to understand
the perspective they come from.

As always, think critically and make your own decisions about what works for you.

## 1. Stop caring about classes

Just do what you need to pass.

> Only spend time on classes once you’ve made progress on your research.

---

## 2. Undergrad versus PhD research

Every student admitted into PhD programs has a lot of potential for creative research, but very few realize it—not because they’re not smart, but due to lacking resilience, perseverance, metacognition, or self-discipline.

> These traits can be fostered through self-reflection and mentorship.

---

## 3. Uncertainty, isolation, and project scoping

- **Uncertainty:** You don’t know if your hard work will pay off.
- **Isolation:** Few people care about what you're doing.
- **Project scoping:** You don’t know how big your paper should be.

**What you should do:**
- Make consistent progress every day.
- Get mentor feedback every 1–2 weeks.
- Submit papers and get external feedback a few times a year.

---

## 4. Develop research taste

How?

- Read good recent papers recommended by your advisor.
- Assist others with their projects.
- Accept that a lot of mediocre work is necessary before developing taste. Keep grinding.

---

## 5. Most of the daily work won’t feel like “research”

If this happens, stay mindful of the big picture. Don’t get trapped in trivialities.

---

## 6. Understand your advisor

If your advisor is pre-tenure, helping them earn tenure will likely depend on your research output.

---

## 7. There is no perfect advisor

People succeed *despite* their advisor’s imperfections. Don’t rely solely on your advisor for your success.

---

## 8. Be patient

- The first 3 years of your PhD may not count toward your dissertation.
- No publications after 3 years? Still okay.
- If your advisor is untenured, expect pressure to publish sooner.

---

## 9. Make professors want to help you

They want to help students who already know how to do research and need less guidance.

> Show your potential to be a good researcher.

---

## 10. Find peer support

PhD isolation is the default. Seek out peers proactively.

---

## 11. Avoid infectious negativity

Even if you’re struggling, try not to spread negativity to others.

---

## 12. Be careful about advice from senior students outside your area

- They may not understand your specific challenges.
- But they *can* offer great advice about navigating your advisor.

---

## 13. Understand your job

Your job in a PhD is to **publish high-quality research papers that contribute valuable new knowledge**.

---

## 14. Make yourself accountable

Be accountable to:
- Other people (e.g., postdocs or collaborators),
- Deadlines (e.g., conference submissions, talks),
- Structures (e.g., lab meetings).

---

## 15. Develop a fixed work schedule

- Always do the most important thing first.
- Research is your #1 priority—not classes, TA work, or admin.

> Suggested: Work on research from 8–11am every day, uninterrupted.

---

## 16. Do everything you can to protect your mornings

Self-explanatory.

---

## 17. Politely turn down volunteer service work requests

Self-explanatory.

---

## 18. Push back against professors who overwork you as a TA

Self-explanatory.

---

## 19. Keep moving

If you’re stuck, **tell your advisor or mentors immediately**.

> Many PhDs fail not from lack of talent, but from getting stuck and demoralized.

---

## 20. Avoid the dreaded loop of despair

Getting stuck → no help → procrastination → worse outcomes.

---

## 21. Everyone is busy—ask for help anyway

If you’ve done your homework, it’s fine to ask busy people for help.

> You are not wasting anyone’s time by being prepared and showing desire to grow.

---

## 22. Managing your advisor

Advisors are good at **making decisions**.

> Don’t ask: *“What do you think of this draft?”*
> Ask: *“Given A and B, should I use model X, Y, or Z?”*

Make it easy for them to help you.

---

## 23. Contact hours

Don’t rely only on metrics like papers or awards.

> Instead, track your **daily contact hours** with core research.

Good target:
- 3–4 hours/day of focused work
- 1–2 hours/week of meetings with advisor

> “Focus on the action, not the result. The result will come.”

---

## 24. My project stinks… should I quit?

- If it’s **your own** project: try sticking with it for 3+ months.
- If it’s **someone else’s**: switch if you’ve earned authorship.
- Always aim to gain transferable skills—even if you leave a project.

> It’s easier to switch projects early in your PhD.

---

## 25. Writing papers

- Takes **much longer** than expected.
- Don’t worry about quality initially—get content down first.

> Even 12 pages of junk is better than a blank page.

---

## 26. Don’t worry about big-talkers

95% of research is done in silence. Don’t feel self-conscious about others who are louder.

> Silent excellence is still recognized.

---

## 27. Don’t compare yourself to other students

Self-explanatory.

---

## 28. Social media and online presence

- You **need** a personal website. It doesn’t need to be fancy.
- Use social media carefully.

> “It may seem like everyone is winning awards or publishing nonstop. Don’t let that derail you.”

> “It’s easier to post online than to grind on research. Focus on your real work.”

> **What matters most for your career is publishing well-regarded papers. Everything else is secondary.**

---

## 29. Commonly observed struggles

- If no faculty can summarize what you’re doing, your work may not be clear or scoped well.
- It’s helpful to be on your advisor’s **critical path**—it keeps you motivated and aligned.
