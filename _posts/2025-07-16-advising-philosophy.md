This is a philosophy for my research group. While it’s primarily written for
students interested in joining the lab, I hope it’s also useful as a reference
point for those evaluating different advising styles more broadly.

> **What's your advising philosophy?**

Ah, the classic question that seems to keep popping up around me.

I’ve been fortunate to learn from a range of mentors with very different
approaches - some deeply hands-on, others highly independent. Each taught me
something: what I want to emulate, and what I want to do differently. This
document reflects the values and practices I hope to bring into my own advising.

Of course, this is not final. My views will evolve (as one would hope).
But I believe it's useful to explicitly write things down so you can
get a sense of what to expect from me, and what I’ll expect from you.

If there are things that you think are missing, or if you have any questions,
please feel free to reach out.

# Advising Philosophy and Expectation Setting

## What is the point of a PhD?

A PhD is a training ground for independent researchers. The goal is not just to
complete projects or publish papers, but to learn how to define problems, manage
uncertainty, and contribute new and meaningful ideas to the world.

My hope is that every student who comes through our lab leaves with the
ability (and confidence) to do world-class research. The best way to become
that kind of researcher is to try. Not through perfection or constant success,
but through thoughtful work, persistence, and ambition.

That said, a PhD is not a commitment to an academic career. The skills you’ll
develop - deep thinking, problem-solving, communication, and self-direction -
are valuable across many paths. I seriously considered leaving academia during
my PhD, and I think that reflection was healthy and important. I’ll support you
wherever your goals lead.

## On world-class research

When I say “world-class research,” I don’t mean publishing *n* papers per year
at top conferences. I mean work that is thoughtful, rigorous, and can stand the
test of time.

To me, that involves:
- Identifying problems that matter - either practically or theoretically;
- Developing deep understanding of both the problem and the surrounding literature;
- Situating your work in the broader context of the field;
- Advancing knowledge through new ideas, theory, methods, or empirical results; and
- Communicating those contributions clearly and convincingly to others.

That may sound abstract - and it is. Great research looks different in
different areas. Still, the core idea is simple: we aim to do careful work on
important questions, and share it in a way that others can understand, trust,
and build on.

### The magnitude of world-class problems and the myth of breakthroughs

Major research problems - those that are impactful to society and push the our
understandings - rarely are solved in a single work. In practice, most real
progress comes through slow, deliberate work: refining ideas, uncovering
structure, building tools, and connecting dots over time.

What we often call a “breakthrough” is usually the result of accumulated
insight. It might be a paper that synthesizes prior work, reframes a problem in
a compelling way, bridges disciplines, or advances an existing line of inquiry -
but it often rests on years of less visible effort.

I say this because it's easy to become paralyzed by the myth of the
breakthrough: the idea that if you’re not solving everything at once, your work
doesn’t matter. That’s false. Chipping away at hard problems is not just
acceptable - it’s the norm (just look at the history of deep learning).
Persistent, thoughtful progress is what good research usually looks like.

## Student background

I don’t expect students to arrive with a highly specific technical background.
Our work spans a broad range - from theoretical and algorithmic research (which
can be done entirely with a good whiteboard and a laptop) to hands-on deployment
of real robots in the field.

What does matter most is a solid foundation in programming, comfort with
mathematical thinking, and - above all - a strong willingness to learn.

You should expect to spend significant time independently building up your
technical skills, especially in areas like mathematics, probability, and
systems-level understanding. That growth is part of the process, and I see it as
a core part of the PhD.

## Independence and choosing research topics

A core goal of the PhD is learning how to define and pursue your own research
agenda. My role is to help you get there - by guiding problem selection early on,
helping develop your ideas, and offering strategic feedback as your independence
grows.

Early in the program, I’ll likely suggest a few well-scoped problems to help you
gain traction. These are meant to build technical skills, familiarity with the
literature, and confidence. Over time, I expect students to take increasing
ownership: identifying research questions, framing them clearly, designing
experiments or theory, and driving day-to-day progress.

Even the most senior researchers seek feedback and collaboration. But by the
later stages of your PhD, you should be operating independently, with me acting
more as a sounding board - someone who can help refine ideas, flag blind spots,
and challenge assumptions.

**Note on funding:** Like any lab, our research will be shaped in part by
funding opportunities. I work to find flexible support that aligns with our
interests, and I aim to keep student-led inquiry at the center. But it’s
important to acknowledge that funding can influence the direction of projects,
especially in applied fields. Typically, funding in robotics is sufficiently
flexible that students can pursue their own interests; the funding requirements
are typically more along the lines of occasional reports and possibly
demonstrations of the work.

## Proposing ideas

I expect students to start proposing their own ideas from day one. Problem
formulation is a core research skill. This takes time, feedback, and repeated
practice to develop.

In my own PhD experience, one of the most valuable aspects of our lab culture
was that students were expected to take intellectual ownership of their work. It
was hard - especially early on - but that challenge accelerated my growth as a
researcher and independent thinker. I aim to foster a similar environment.

Your early ideas don’t need to be polished or correct. What matters is engaging
actively with the research process: spotting gaps, questioning assumptions, and
thinking creatively about where to go next.

## What is a good problem?

There’s no single formula for what makes a good research problem - but there are
useful patterns. One framework I like (shared with me by Robert Mahony) evaluates
problems along five axes:

- **Impact**: Is this problem important? Will solving it matter to others - scientifically, societally, or practically?
- **Novelty**: Does it advance how we think about a problem? Does it offer a new perspective, method, or insight?
- **Feasibility**: Can we make real progress in a reasonable amount of time? Is the scope right - not too narrow, not too vast?
- **Interest**: Are you genuinely excited by it? Will you care enough to stick with it when it gets hard?
- **Resources**: Do we have (or can we find) the tools, time, and collaborators needed to work on it effectively?

The balance of these factors changes over time. For a first-year student,
feasibility and interest often matter most - especially when building confidence
and momentum. Your first project doesn’t have to be world-changing. My own first
research problem wasn't that impactful but it gave me a solid foundation to
build on.

Choosing good problems is a really important topic, so for more discussion of this
I recommend checking out my [collection of PhD advice]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2025/phd-advice/).
There's a lot of writing on this and I think it is largely in agreement, so I won't
go into any more detail here.

## What does progress look like?

Progress in research is often nonlinear and unpredictable. Some weeks feel like
breakthroughs, others are spent debugging a tool, reading papers, or reframing
the problem entirely. That’s normal.

Two questions can help you reflect on whether you're moving forward:
- **Time**: Are you consistently spending focused time on your research?
- **Value**: Is that time moving your project or understanding in a meaningful direction?

Not all progress looks like new results. It can include:
- Developing a deeper understanding of the literature
- Asking sharper and more focused research questions
- Writing or refactoring tools that improve your workflow
- Explaining your work more clearly than before
- Gaining autonomy in how you scope, plan, and execute your work

One of the most valuable weeks I spent during my PhD involved nothing but
reading. I went deep into the literature for my specific field, identified
patterns and gaps that weren't commonly acknowledged by other practitioners, and
developed a much clearer view of where my work could contribute. I wrote no
code, proved no theorems, and produced no paper. Still, this time fundamentally
shaped my future research and gave me the necessary background to make
meaningful progress.

In my mind, one key is to - with some frequency - ask: *What is the best use of my time right now?* And then
act on that. Don't do this every day, otherwise you will never get anything done. But do it often enough that you are
relatively confident that you are working on the right things.

At a high level, some soft benchmarks can be useful. A common goal is to
contribute to 2–3 paper submissions per year, including both first-author and
collaborative work. But this is not a hard rule. One strong, well-executed paper
may matter more than several minor ones, and some years will be heavier on
exploration, learning, or tool-building.

If you ever feel stuck or unsure whether you're making progress, that’s a good
time to talk.

## Expectations by stage

This is a rough outline of what I expect from students at different stages of
their PhD. Of course, every student and project is different, so this is just a
general guideline. We’ll adapt it to fit your specific situation and goals.

**Year 1**: Focus on building technical skills, understanding the literature,
and developing confidence in your ability to define and pursue research
problems. A great goal is to complete a first project that results in a paper
submission. This could be a small but well-scoped problem that you can execute
independently with some guidance. You should also be able to explain your work
clearly and articulate its contributions.

**Year 2-3**: Start taking ownership of research problems, proposing ideas, and
developing your own projects. You should be able to independently scope and
execute a project, with me providing guidance on framing, methodology, and
feedback on your work. If there are certain areas to explore, collaborations to
start, or tools to build, this can be a good time to do so. Midway through year
2 I strongly suggest you start drafting a proposal for your thesis topic.  This
is not a final declaration of the work you will do - it can change completely
and parts can be added or removed - but this is a good time to start really
establishing this high-level vision for what you want to do.

**Year 4+**: By this point, you should be operating largely independently,
with me acting as a sounding board for ideas, feedback on papers, and high-level
guidance. You should be able to define your own research agenda, identify
important problems, and execute projects with minimal oversight. My goal here is
to enable you to do your best work (likely by largely stepping back and giving
you the space and resources needed).

## Mentorship style

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to mentoring. Every student is different,
and my style will adapt to fit your goals, working style, and stage of progress.
That said, there are core principles that guide how I work with students:

**Student development**: As you progress, I expect you to take increasing
ownership of your research - choosing problems, developing ideas, and charting
your own path with growing independence.

**Independence**: I’ll provide mentorship, structure, and feedback - but I expect
students to be self-directed, take initiative, and actively drive their own
learning and progress. The whole point of a PhD is to learn how to do
independent research.

**Priorities**: Who you are as a person matters more than who you are as a
researcher. Your health and relationships come first. Research is important,
but it comes after family (however you define it) and well-being.

**Level of involvement**: I aim to be an engaged mentor, especially early on. I
expect to work closely with students on ideas, experiments, and papers. As you
grow more confident and experienced, I’ll step back and give you more space.
We’ll calibrate together how much guidance and feedback is helpful at each
stage.

**What I’ll work on with you**: I'm hands-on with research development. I will help
scope problems, refine ideas, design experiments, and write papers. I also put
a strong emphasis on communication skills. I’ll support you in writing, giving
talks, and clearly articulating your contributions.

**Expectations and communication**: I try to be clear about expectations, and I
want students to feel comfortable asking when something is unclear. I’ll also
encourage you to set your own expectations and goals and communicate them to
me.

**Career development**: I’ll support you in whatever path you choose: academia,
industry, startups, or elsewhere. That includes helping find opportunities,
preparing applications, doing mock interviews, and connecting you with
colleagues in relevant fields.


## Communication

I aim to meet with each student regularly - typically once per week. This cadence
may vary depending on the project stage and your needs, but you should expect
consistent, dedicated time to discuss your work and get feedback. These meetings
are also time for you to ask questions on things beyond the project, such as
career advice, technical skills, or general research questions.

Between meetings, I encourage you to reach out via Slack or email with updates,
questions, or thoughts. Don’t wait for a polished result - often the most valuable
conversations happen when you're stuck or exploring an idea. I'm also happy to
drop by for informal check-ins or quick chats when something comes up.

Clear and frequent communication is critical for good advising. I’ll do my part
to be responsive and available - and I ask for the same in return.

## Authorship and collaboration

I believe in giving credit where credit is due. If you contribute meaningfully
to a project (through ideas, implementation, writing, or experimentation) you
should be recognized as a co-author. I generally follow common authorship
conventions in robotics, but I’m always open to discussing authorship decisions
transparently and early.

I also strongly encourage collaboration - both within our lab and across labs,
institutions, and disciplines. Many of the best ideas emerge from unexpected
conversations, and I’ll support you in building those connections and pursuing
joint work when it advances the science.


## Time management and work-life balance

A PhD is a marathon, not a sprint. I expect students to work hard and take their
research seriously, but I also expect you to rest, take care of yourself, and
maintain a life outside the lab. Sustainable progress comes from consistency,
not burnout.

There will occasionally be intense pushes before deadlines, but those should be
rare, not the default. If you're feeling overwhelmed or burned out, I want to
hear about it. We can revisit timelines, adjust priorities, and find a better
pace. Long-term health (mental and physical) is important.

## Feedback and iteration

I give direct, detailed feedback, especially on writing, presentations, and
project direction. It is never about getting things perfect on the first try;
iteration is at the core of research. You will improve through cycles of doing,
reflecting, and revising.

One way to make feedback more effective is to clarify what kind of input you are
looking for. For example, are you seeking big-picture feedback on your research
framing, or line-level edits on a nearly finished talk? Letting me know helps me
tailor my response to where you are in the process.

It is also important to remember that the way you present your work shapes the
kind of feedback you receive. A rough draft invites different comments than a
polished one. Being mindful of this, and communicating your goals, will make our
feedback loops more productive.

I value students who engage with feedback actively, who reflect, revise, ask
questions, and even push back when they disagree.

## Reproducibility and research artifacts

Our goal is to produce research that others can build on. This means writing
clean, well-documented code, organizing experiments clearly, and making results
reproducible whenever possible.

I do not expect perfection, but I do expect students to value clarity,
maintainability, and reusability in their code and data practices. If others
can't understand, reproduce, or build on your work, it limits its impact.

## Final thoughts

Graduate school is a rare opportunity for deep growth - as a thinker, a builder,
and a person. My goal is to help each student become an independent, critical
thinker who is prepared for whatever comes next.

That process takes time, effort, and communication on both sides. I’ll work to
support you and our lab community, and I’ll ask that you do the same.
