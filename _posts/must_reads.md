# Self-Improvement, Organizational Culture, Teams, and Productivity

This is a list of non-technical must reads that are great for grad students.
I've loved all of these books, not to say that I agree with everything in them
or that they are equally helpful for all people.  In general, these books were
tremendously helpful in navigating a lot of different aspects of grad school
(and life in general).

I will keep updating this list as I read more books.  As I'm starting my lab,
I'm debating making some of these books required reading for my students. If
this experiment happens, I will update this list with the feedback I get from my
students.

If you have any suggestions for books that should be on this list, please let me
know!

# Fun Reads

This is a collection of (mostly) fiction books that I've read and loved.  I will
try to keep this list updated as I read more books.  If you have any suggestions
for books that should be on this list, please let me know!


## Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke

Terrific! So much depth to the characters and the world.

## Dune by Frank Herbert

This was required reading in my house growing up. It's been a while since I read
it, but is still one of my favorites and was fairly formative for me.

## Ender's Game (and the rest of the series) by Orson Scott Card

## The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdos and the Search for Mathematical Truth by Paul Hoffman
