For my undergraduate Mechanical Design I class (UIUC ME370) a group of us designed a ballerina-themed
walker. This included all forms of linkage analysis to determine the appropriate
walker mechanism. I was lucky to work alongside three very talented classmates on
this project: Ian Bashor, Jiheng Jing, and Sunyu Wang.
