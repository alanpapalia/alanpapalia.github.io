To accurately manufacture the steel-tube spaceframe component of our Formula SAE
car I designed and manufactured a jigging system out of steel sheets. The
jigging was designed such that the frame could be assembled inside the jigging,
welded, and then normalized with an oxy-acetylene torch to reduce thermal
stresses and warpage of the final weldment.

The mostly-welded spaceframe assembled in the jig. Some final welds and minor
rework were done after cutting the spaceframe out of the jig (for ease of
access).
