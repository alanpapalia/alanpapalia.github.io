<span style="color:red;"> I am actively recruiting PhD students for the upcoming year </span>

<p style="color:blue;">
I am joining the University of Michigan as an Assistant Professor in the <a
href="https://name.engin.umich.edu/">NAME</a> department.  If you're interested
in developing robots that can operate independently in unstructured and remote
environments, please see the information below on working with me and then email
me.

## A bit about me

I am an incoming Assistant Professor to the University of Michigan.  I am
spending 2025 as a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University, working
with
<!-- Hanu Singh and Michael Everett -->
<a href="https://www.ece.neu.edu/people/singh-hanumant">Hanu Singh</a> and
<a href="https://www.ece.neu.edu/people/everett-michael">Michael Everett</a>
on various problems in field robotics and robotic navigation.
I received my PhD in 2024 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution <a href="https://mit.whoi.edu/">
Joint Program</a>, where I worked with a tremendous group of people in the
<a href="http://marinerobotics.mit.edu">Marine Robotics Group</a> under the
supervision of John Leonard. During my graduate studies I was lucky to be chosen
as a MathWorks Fellow, a Woods Hole Next Wave Fellow, and an Undersea Technology
Innovation Scholar.

**My research** develops fundamental capabilities for field
robotics, with a focus on building the tools necessary for autonomous ocean
observation and maintaining the health of our planet. I believe that robotics
has a critical role to play in understanding and protecting our world, particularly
in the face of climate change. My work seeks to identify problems where robotics
can make a meaningful difference and develop the algorithms and systems necessary to
unlock this impact.

My PhD research focused on enabling long-term, low-cost underwater navigation (a
serious limitation to widespread autonomous ocean observation). This direction
led to the development of a
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11614">state-of-the-art SLAM backend</a> --
built on tools from optimization, geometry, and graph theory -- that is both
faster than existing methods and provides rigorous performance guarantees. This
paints a picture of future work I am interested in: solving fundamental robotics
problems that are motivated by important societal challenges.

## Want to work with me?

If you are interested in working with me, read the information below and then
reach out with a short email outlining your background and interests. I am
looking for students who are excited to advance the state of the art in
robotics and to tackle difficult fundamental problems in localization, state
estimation, and autonomous monitoring of the environment.

Excellence comes from a wide range of past experiences. There is no single path
that I expect students to come from, and I strongly encourage applications from
all people.  I believe the most important characteristics for success are
intrinsic motivation, a drive to work on important and challenging problems, and
an ability to push through when things aren't working.  Ideally, you should have
at least one core strength (e.g.  mathematical problem solving, programming,
robotics experience, deep learning research) and be excited to develop
additional strengths over the course of your PhD. It is helpful to have prior
programming experience and some technical project or work experience outside of
the classroom (e.g. research, internships, work, projects).

A short (and incomplete) list of topics that I am excited about includes:
- **Localization and navigation (SLAM)** -- specifically, I am interested in
  long-term, low-cost navigation. We want to build smarter robotic systems that
  intelligently fuse information from a combination of sensors in ways that are
  more robust and reliable than existing systems.
- **Long-term autonomy in challenging environments** -- developing
  algorithms that allow robots to operate independently for long periods of time
  in difficult conditions.
- **Field robotics** -- developing systems that can operate in challenging and
  remote environments, with a particular focus on underwater systems.
- **Adaptive sampling and exploration** -- developing algorithms that allow robots
  to make intelligent decisions about where to go and what to measure in order
  to maximize the information gained (with a focus on environmental monitoring).
- **Merging machine learning and model-based robotic systems** -- finding
  effective ways to combine data-driven and model-based approaches to leverage
  the strengths of both.
- **Algorithms with provable performance guarantees** -- building systems
  that are robust to noise, uncertainty, outliers, and other practical challenges.
- **Learned sensor models** -- developing algorithms that can learn the
  characteristics of sensors and use this information to improve the performance
  of robotic systems.

The common thread in all of these topics is that advances in these directions
will lead to serious improvements in what robots can do in the wild, allowing
for people to apply robotics to solve important problems in the world. My
underlying motivation is developing robots that allow us to better understand
the natural world, but the technologies we work on are fundamental tools in robotics
and are relevant anytime we want to deploy robots in the real world.
