I am a PhD student in Robotics with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute <a href="https://mit.whoi.edu/">
Joint Program</a>. I'm fortunate to work in the <a
href="http://marinerobotics.mit.edu"> Marine Robotics Group</a>, under <a
href="https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/JLEONARD@MIT.EDU"> Prof. John
Leonard</a>.

My research seeks to leverages graph theory, probability, and geometry to build
novel optimization approaches for robotic localization and mapping. The
overarching goal of this research is to develop robust and reliable perception
systems for robotics.

Before working in robotics I spent my undergraduate years working with a great
group of people on the <a href="https://motorsports.illinois.edu/"> Illini
Motorsports Formula SAE </a> team. Here I oversaw a team of over 40 members,
engaged in a number of mechanical design projects, and took part in a number of
international competitions.

Helping to mitigate climate change is of huge importance to me and is a central
aspect to my future plans.
