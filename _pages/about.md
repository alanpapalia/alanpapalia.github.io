<span style="color:red;"> I am actively recruiting PhD students for the upcoming
year. </span>
See the information on my
<a href="/join/">Join Us</a> page for how to reach out if you are interested in working with me.
I also welcome inquiries from prospective postdocs, and
University of Michigan undergrads.

## A bit about me

I am an incoming Assistant Professor to the University of Michigan.  I am
currently a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University, working with
<a href="https://www.ece.neu.edu/people/singh-hanumant">Hanu Singh</a> and
<a href="https://www.ece.neu.edu/people/everett-michael">Michael Everett</a>
on robotic navigation.  I received my PhD in 2024 from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution <a
href="https://mit.whoi.edu/"> Joint Program</a>, where I was lucky to work with
<a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/john-leonard">John Leonard</a>.

**My research** develops algorithms and systems that enable robots to
explore and monitor challenging environments, with a particular focus on
underwater environments. We work on the tools that will allow
future robots to autonomously study and understand the natural world.

<!-- My PhD research focused on enabling long-term, low-cost underwater navigation (a
serious limitation to widespread autonomous ocean observation). This direction
led to the development of a
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11614">state-of-the-art SLAM backend</a> --
built on tools from optimization, geometry, and graph theory -- that is both
faster than existing methods and provides rigorous performance guarantees. This
paints a picture of future work I am interested in: solving fundamental robotics
problems that are motivated by important societal challenges. -->
