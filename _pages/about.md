<span style="color:red;"> I am actively recruiting PhD students for the upcoming year </span>

<p style="color:blue;">
I am joining the University of Michigan as an Assistant Professor in the <a
href="https://name.engin.umich.edu/">NAME</a> department.  If you're interested
in developing robots that can operate independently in unstructured and remote
environments, please see the information below on working with me and then email
me.

## A bit about me

I am an incoming Assistant Professor to the University of Michigan.  I am
spending 2025 as a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University, working
with
<!-- Hanu Singh and Michael Everett -->
<a href="https://www.ece.neu.edu/people/singh-hanumant">Hanu Singh</a> and
<a href="https://www.ece.neu.edu/people/everett-michael">Michael Everett</a>
on various problems in field robotics and robotic navigation.
I received my PhD in 2024 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution <a href="https://mit.whoi.edu/">
Joint Program</a>, where I worked with a tremendous group of people in the
<a href="http://marinerobotics.mit.edu">Marine Robotics Group</a> under the
supervision of John Leonard.

**My research** develops fundamental capabilities for field
robotics, with a focus on building the tools necessary for autonomous ocean
observation and maintaining the health of our planet. I believe that robotics
has a critical role to play in understanding and protecting our world, particularly
in the face of climate change. My work seeks to identify problems where robotics
can make a meaningful difference and develop the algorithms and systems necessary to
unlock this impact.

My PhD research focused on enabling long-term, low-cost underwater navigation (a
serious limitation to widespread autonomous ocean observation). This direction
led to the development of a
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11614">state-of-the-art SLAM backend</a> --
built on tools from optimization, geometry, and graph theory -- that is both
faster than existing methods and provides rigorous performance guarantees. This
paints a picture of future work I am interested in: solving fundamental robotics
problems that are motivated by important societal challenges.

### Honors and Awards
