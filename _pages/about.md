I am a PhD student in Robotics with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute <a href="https://mit.whoi.edu/">
Joint Program</a>. I'm fortunate to work in the <a
href="http://marinerobotics.mit.edu"> Marine Robotics Group</a>, with <a
href="https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/JLEONARD@MIT.EDU"> John
Leonard</a>.

My research focuses on the development of algorithms which enable widespread
deployment of autonomous systems for low-cost, long-term environmental
monitoring. Largely, I want to develop systems that advance scientific
understanding of our world by improving the capable spatial and temporal
resolution of our observations. Though I develop domain-agnostic methodologies,
I am largely inspired by applications in marine environments. Climate, oceans,
and the health of our planet are all topics that I am
passionate about. I believe that the development of autonomous systems will
enable us to better understand and protect our world and its ecosystems.

My work typically exists at the intersection of probabilistic inference,
mathematical optimization, and geometry. Largely, I focus on building
more robust algorithms with provable performance guarantees. These algorithmic
advances enable improved navigational capabilities, allowing for lower cost
sensors and generally expanding the performance envelope of existing systems.

Before grad school, I spent my undergraduate years working with a great group of
people on the <a href="https://motorsports.illinois.edu/"> Illini Motorsports
Formula SAE </a> team. Here I oversaw a team of over 40 members, led system
design as well as design of several key components, and took part in a number of
international competitions.
