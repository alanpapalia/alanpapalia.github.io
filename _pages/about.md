<p style="color:blue;">I am joining the University of Michigan as an Assistant
Professor in the <a href="https://name.umich.edu/">NAME</a> department in
January 2026. If you're interested in working with me, please see the
information below.</p>

## a bit about me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University, working with
<!-- Hanu Singh and Michael Everett -->
<a href="https://www.ece.neu.edu/people/singh-hanumant">Hanu Singh</a> and
<a href="https://www.ece.neu.edu/people/everett-michael">Michael Everett</a>.
I received my PhD in 2024 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution <a href="https://mit.whoi.edu/">
Joint Program</a>, where I worked with a tremendous group of people in the
<a href="http://marinerobotics.mit.edu">Marine Robotics Group</a> under the
supervision of
John Leonard. During my graduate studies I was lucky to be chosen as a
MathWorks Fellow, a Woods Hole Next Wave Fellow, and an Undersea Technology
Innovation Scholar.

**My research** develops fundamental capabilities for field
robotics, with a focus on building the tools necessary for autonomous ocean
observation and maintaining the health of our planet. I believe that robotics
has a critical role to play in understanding and protecting our world, particularly
in the face of climate change. My work seeks to identify problems where robotics
can make a meaningful difference and develop the algorithms and systems necessary to
unlock this impact.

My PhD research focused on enabling long-term, low-cost underwater navigation (a
serious limitation to widespread autonomous ocean observation). This direction
led to the development of a
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11614">state-of-the-art SLAM backend</a> --
built on tools from optimization, geometry, and graph theory -- that is both
faster than existing methods and provides rigorous performance guarantees. This paints
a picture of future work I am interested in: solving fundamental robotics problems
that are motivated by important societal challenges.

## want to work with me?

I am not admitting students for the upcoming academic year (2025-2026). If you
are interested in working with me starting in Fall of 2026, feel free to reach
out to me now and we may be able to discuss potential fit.

Excellence comes from a wide range of past experiences; there is no single path
that I expect, and I strongly encourage applications from people of all backgrounds
and identities.  Most important to me is an intrinsic motivation for self-growth
and a drive to work on important and challenging problems.  Ideally, you should
have at least one core strength (e.g.  mathematical problem solving,
programming, robotics experience, deep learning research) and be excited to
develop additional strengths over the course of your PhD. Additionally, it is helpful
to have prior programming experience and some technical project or work experience
outside of the classroom (e.g. research, internships, work, projects).

A short (and very incomplete) list of topics that I am excited about includes:
- **Long-term autonomy in challenging environments** -- developing
  algorithms that allow robots to operate independently for long periods of time
  in difficult conditions.
- **Field robotics** -- developing systems that can operate in challenging and
  remote environments, such as the ocean, forests, deserts, and polar regions.
- **Adaptive sampling and exploration** -- developing algorithms that allow robots
  to make intelligent decisions about where to go and what to measure in order
  to maximize the information gained.
- **Merging machine learning and model-based robotic systems** -- finding
  effective ways to combine data-driven and model-based approaches to leverage
  the strengths of both.
- **Algorithms with provable performance guarantees** -- building systems
  that are robust to noise, uncertainty, outliers, and other practical challenges.
- **Learned sensor models** -- developing algorithms that can learn the
  characteristics of sensors and use this information to improve the quality of
  data collected.
