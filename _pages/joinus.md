I am seeking **highly motivated PhD students to start in Fall 2026**. See below for more
information on my research interests and what I look for in prospective
students.

## Our Research

We are roboticists who develop cutting edge algorithms and systems for field
robotics. Our work is inspired by exploration and monitoring of the
Earth's challenging and remote environments, with important applications to
climate change and environmental monitoring.

We pull on techniques from a variety of disciplines, including:

- **Mathematical Optimization**
- **Perception and Computer Vision**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Probability and Estimation**
- **Riemannian Geometry**

## Why This Work Matters

Understanding and adapting to our changing climate requires tools that can
operate in the world’s most challenging environments, from deep oceans to dense
forests and under the polar ice. Our mission is to design robotic systems
capable of making meaningful contributions to climate science and adaptation
efforts, all while advancing the field of robotics through application-inspired
fundamental research.

## Want to Work With Me?

<!-- The best way to work with me is to apply to a Master’s or PhD program in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon; I will recruit mostly from the Machine Learning Department and Robotics Institue PhD applications. I’m particularly excited about students who love to think deeply and hatch truly new (sometimes crazy) ideas, and am looking for candidates across the theory-to-practice spectrum. An ideal applicant should come in with at least one core strength (e.g. mathematical problem solving, software engineering, deep learning research), and be eager to develop other abilities as the PhD continues. I strongly encourage students who come from a diverse set of backgrounds to apply, including racial, gender, sexual and religious identities, political beliefs, socioeconomic and disability statuses, and non-traditional educational/professional paths. Unfortunately, I am not able to take on research interns who are in high school, or who are undergraduates/Master’s students at institutions other than CMU, at this time. If you belong to the latter category, please apply to a CMU Master’s/PhD! -->

I am not admitting students for the upcoming academic year (2025-2026). If you
are interested in working with me starting in Fall of 2026, feel free to reach
out to me now and we may be able to discuss potential fit.

We are seeking driven individuals to join our team.

Interested applicants should have:
- Prior programming experience
- Independent problem-solving skills
- Exceptional drive and motivation
- Technical project or work experience outside of the classroom
- A collaborative mindset and eagerness to contribute to a team environment

Our lab recognizes that excellence comes from a range of backgrounds and
experiences. We do not expect a specific background in robotics or computer
science.
