## How to reach out

<span style="color:red;"> I am actively recruiting PhD students for the upcoming year </span>

See below for how to reach out if you are interested in working with me. I
welcome inquiries from prospective PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and
University of Michigan undergraduate students.

To make sure I see your email, please make the subject line of your
email should follow the format
`"[Important] Prospective UMich <Position>"`.
For example, if you are a prospective PhD student, the subject line should be
`"[Important] Prospective UMich PhD Student"`.

Send your email to: apapalia [at ] umich [dot ] edu

## Prospective PhD Students

If you are interested in applying to PhDs, read the information below and then
reach out with a short email with your CV and a brief paragraph on what you are
interested in working on and why this interests you (any relevant experience is
useful to highlight).

I am looking for students who are excited to advance the state of the art in
robotics and to tackle difficult fundamental problems in localization, state
estimation, and autonomous monitoring of the environment.

A short (and incomplete) list of topics that I am excited about includes:
- **Localization and navigation (SLAM)** -- specifically, I am interested in
  long-term, low-cost navigation. We want to build smarter robotic systems that
  intelligently fuse information from a combination of sensors in ways that are
  more robust and reliable than existing systems.
- **Long-term autonomy in challenging environments** -- developing
  algorithms that allow robots to operate independently for long periods of time
  in difficult conditions.
- **Field robotics** -- developing systems that can operate in challenging and
  remote environments, with a particular focus on underwater systems.
- **Adaptive sampling and exploration** -- developing algorithms that allow robots
  to make intelligent decisions about where to go and what to measure in order
  to maximize the information gained (with a focus on environmental monitoring).
- **Merging machine learning and model-based robotic systems** -- finding
  effective ways to combine data-driven and model-based approaches to leverage
  the strengths of both.
- **Algorithms with provable performance guarantees** -- building systems
  that are robust to noise, uncertainty, outliers, and other practical challenges.
- **Learned sensor models** -- developing algorithms that can learn the
  characteristics of sensors and use this information to improve the performance
  of robotic systems.

The common thread in all of these topics is that advances in these directions
will lead to serious improvements in what robots can do in the wild, allowing
for people to apply robotics to solve important problems in the world. My
underlying motivation is developing robots that allow us to better understand
the natural world, but the technologies we work on are fundamental tools in robotics
and are relevant anytime we want to deploy robots in the real world.

## Current University of Michigan Undergraduates

I prefer undergraduate researchers who are available for *full-time
research* in the coming summer.

**Still interested?** Please send:
- A brief email confirming your full-time availability for the coming summer
- Your resume
- Your (unofficial) transcript
- Two short paragraphs explaining why you want to get involved

## Postdoctoral Researchers

Send me an email with your CV, three representative publications, and a
description of what you are interested in working on.
