I'm fortunate to have a lot of fun outside my work (which is also a lot of
fun!). Many of my adventures are shared with my brilliant wife, Kristan
Hilby-Papalia. We spend time enjoying the outdoors and try to bring our (loving
but lazy) dog along. I also have a few great friends who occasionally brighten
up these journeys and excursions.

Below is an incomplete and unorganized collection of these moments.

## Big Sky, Montana

While Kristan was presenting her exciting work on morphing-wing airfoils at the
IEEE Aerospace Conference, I took the opportunity to enjoy the powder.
Thankfully, the conference schedule worked out so we were able to get more than
enough runs together :-)
