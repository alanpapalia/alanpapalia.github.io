in tackling climate change.  Thankfully, I’m not the only one thinking about
this.</p>

<p>More specifically, I’ve come across a number of other people in the marine
robotics community who wonder where they could be focusing their efforts to make
the most impact. This isn’t surprising; marine robotics has a long history of
boosting the efforts of various Earth sciences by providing new ways to observe
the ocean.</p>

<p>For an amazing example, of an incredibly simple ‘robot’ making a huge impact we
can look to the Argo float program. Right now there are over 3,000 Argo floats
drifting around the world’s oceans. All they do is periodically sink and rise in
the the water column, taking a few measurements along the way and transmitting
all of their data when they surface. They have relatively little autonomy and
just go where the currents take them. Still, they’ve revolutionized our
scientific capabilities. For example, the Argo float program has provided
order-of-magnitude improvements in our ability to monitor the ocean’s heat
content, giving us a much better understanding of <em>how</em> and <em>where</em> the ocean is
warming.

<p>In fact, while the ability to observe the ocean has never been greater, our
observational capabilities are still arguably the greatest limiting factor in
our scientific understanding of the Earth’s systems. We need to continue to develop
our observational tools.</p>

<p>One of the greatest insights from the Argo program (and other similar advances)
is that the program was not led by engineers or roboticists, but by oceanographers.
This underlies it’s success; the program was <strong>science-driven</strong> and the floats
were designed to best meet the needs of the scientific community. I believe this
is how the next</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="climate," /><category term="marine" /><category term="robotics" /><category term="climate," /><category term="earth" /><category term="science," /><category term="marine" /><category term="robotics," /><category term="oceanography" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What are the observational gaps that marine robotics can look to fill?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Everything starts somewhere</title><link href="https://alanpapalia.github.io/blog/2025/hello-world/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Everything starts somewhere" /><published>2025-01-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://alanpapalia.github.io/blog/2025/hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://alanpapalia.github.io/blog/2025/hello-world/"><![CDATA[<p>I have a few different ideas for thoughts I want to share (okay, I have too many ideas).
