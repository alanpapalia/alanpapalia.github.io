			      <h1>About Me</h1> <br> <br>
				    <p>

				        I am a PhD student in Robotics with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute <a href="https://mit.whoi.edu/"> Joint Program </a>. I'm fortunate to be working in alongside great people in the <a href="http://marinerobotics.mit.edu"> Marine Robotics Group</a>, under John Leonard. <br> <br>

                Previously, I was lucky to spend a summer working on object pose estimation with Cindy Grimm and Ravi Balasubramanian in the <a href="https://robotics.oregonstate.edu/"> Collaborative Robotics and Intelligent Systems Institute</a> of Oregon State University.  <br> <br>

				        In addition to my work in robotics, I have experience working in a range of traditional engineering roles. I spent much of my undergrad working with Illini Motorsports, UIUC's <a href="/projects/fsae">Formula SAE team</a>. I spent most of my time working on the Chassis subsystem, though in my last year also took on the role of Team Captain and led the overall vehicle architecture. At Illinois I also spent time performing <a href="/projects/research">research</a> in the lab of Prof. Placid Ferreira, mostly in the design of cloud manufacturing systems. Additionally, I spent a great summer working with the people of <a href="https://www.seuratech.com/"> Seurat Technologies</a>, on their innovative metal printing process. <br> <br>

				        I'm always open to new opportunities! Send me an <a href="mailto:alanpapalia@gmail.com"> email </a> if you think our interests match.
